**Problem 1.1** Consider the vectors
$$
𝐚 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad  𝐛 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2{\rm i} \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Use reflections to determine the entries of orthogonal/unitary matrices $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$ such that
$$
Q_1 𝐚 = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, Q_2 𝐚 = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
Q_3 𝐛 = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$



**Problem 1.2** What simple rotation matrices $Q_1,Q_2 ∈ SO(2)$ have the property that:
$$
Q_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{5} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},  Q_2 \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{5} \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$



**Problem 1.3** Find an orthogonal matrix that is a product of two simple rotations but
acting on two different subspaces:
$$
Q  = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \cos θ_2 & & -\sin θ_2  \\ & 1 \\
\sin θ_2  & & \cos θ_2  \end{bmatrix}}_{Q_2} \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \cos θ_1 & -\sin θ_1  \\ \sin θ_1 & \cos θ_1 \\ && 1 \end{bmatrix}}_{Q_1}
$$
so that, for $𝐚$ defined in 1.1, 
$$
Q 𝐚  = \begin{bmatrix} \|𝐚\| \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Hint: you do not need to determine $θ_1, θ_2$, instead you can write the entries of  $Q_1, Q_2$ 
directly using just square-roots.

**Problem 2.1** Show that every matrix $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$ has a  QR factorisation such that the diagonal of $R$ is non-negative.
Make sure to include the case of more columns than rows (i.e. $m < n$). You may use the fact from lectures that a QR factorisation
exists (but not necessarily with positive diagonals) whenever $m ≥ n$.



**Problem 2.2** Show that the QR factorisation of a square invertible matrix $A ∈ ℝ^{n × n}$ is unique,
provided that the diagonal of $R$ is positive. You may use Problem 3.5 from PS4, which
states that an orthogonal matrix whose eigenvalues are all 1 must be equal to the identity.
Hint: a product of two orthogonal matrices is also orthogonal.

**Problem 3.1** Show that if $U$ is triangular and normal ($U^⋆ U = U U^⋆$) then it is diagonal.




**Problem 3.2** Show that every matrix $A ∈ ℂ^{n × n}$ has a _Schur decomposition_: it can be written
as
$$
A = Q U Q^⋆
$$
where $U$ is upper-triangular with the eigenvalues of $A$ on the diagonal. Hint: you may use the Jordan canonical form
$$
A = V J V^{-1}
$$
where $J$ is upper-triangular with eigenvalues of $A$ on the diagonal.



**Problem 3.3** Prove the spectral theorem for normal matrices: for every normal matrix $A ∈ ℂ^{n × n}$
 there exists a unitary matrix $Q$ such that
$$
A = Q Λ Q^⋆
$$
where $Λ$ is diagonal.
